## Editor's Note

Happy equinox fellow Originals! Welcome to spring, complete with bees, pollen, allergies, heat, and Daylight Savings Time. (Why is Daylight Savings Time still a thing? Seriously.) But spring isn’t all that bad since it comes with brand new issue of Origins about games!

To the best of my knowledge, since humans began doing things, we’ve always entertained ourselves somehow. Which brings us to Issue 12: Game On! Gaming culture is all around us. We’ve
decided to celebrate the close of three years at Origins with fun. From the origins of dice and chess, racing and geometry, to virtual reality, gaming has come a long way. Where did our
favorite games come from and where are they heading? This is what we strive to question, answer, and explore.

You’ve made it this far in your literary quest for knowledge. Choose the journey you seek and discover the rich culture of the gaming community. (This page may be my “Introductory
Rambling” sidequest, but I promise the rest of the issue is much more entertaining.) You may notice new ways to interact with this issue along with Ethan’s “Useless Gaming Trivia” scattered throughout the pages. Games are intertwined with many aspects of our lives. In the past, they came with scientific bundles of knowledge; today, these materialize or beckon us into virtual worlds. Each can teach us a lesson: biology, collaboration, engineering, English, math, physics, psychology, technology, and more. What games do you play and what have they taught you? Share your stories on our social media pages or send a letter to the editor! Without an audience, it would be Game Over.
