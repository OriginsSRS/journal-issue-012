If you look up dice in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, you will find them defined as "a small
cube that is made of plastic, wood, etc., that has one to six dots on each side, and that is used usually in pairs in various games." This definition covers the broadest uses of dice today, but it does a terrible disservice to the diversity of dice and games of chance. A broader, and more historically accurate, definition would be something like this "small polyhedral objects inscribed with numbers or symbols, designed to be thrown to produce random results." I might mention games in my definition, if it weren't for the completely serious tradition of Cleromancy, in which the future is divined by the drawing of lots and the casting of dice.
